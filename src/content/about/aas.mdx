# Ås node

The ELIXIR node at Ås is part of Centre for Integrative Genetics (CIGENE), Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences, Faculty of Biosciences, at the [Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU)](https://www.nmbu.no/en).

We are an active partner in both the International Cooperation to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome (ICSASG) and coordinating the EU Horizon 2020 project Advancing European Aquaculture by Genome Functional Annotation (AQUA-FAANG).

The Ås node will make _fish genomic resources_ available to the ELIXIR-network, with a particular focus on the Atlantic salmon genome. Web based solutions and e-infrastructure for analysing and sharing species-specific and comparative genomics resources are currently under development.
