# How to get help

Contact us by email at [support@elixir.no](mailto:support@elixir.no).

<Callout title="How it works?" variant="info">When a request is submitted, it is broadcasted to all members of the
    Helpdesk. The request is then picked up by the member who has the most expertise on the particular topic. Please
    note that response times may vary depending on the capacity and availability of the Helpdesk team members at any
    given time.</Callout>

# Usage instructions

ELIXIR Norway also hosts a documentation for the use of our infrastructure. The documentation can be found [here](https://nels-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Support model

Projects that can be solved within two working days or less are free of charge (enabled by funding from the Research Council of Norway). For more comprehensive projects, an hourly rate applies, and you need to **enter an agreement with ELIXIR Norway** on this.

Projects that require an effort beyond technical assistance/consultancy may be set up as a research collaboration, e.g. by providing funding for a percentage of the position of a helpdesk member.

<Card title="The Service Agreement">
    For requests that require platform contribution for more than two days, an agreement
    between the client and the platform must be made. The agreement should cover type and cost of the service. If
    applicable, the agreement should also cover a plan for _publication_ and _co-authorship_. Regardless of the type of
    contribution the platform has given to a project, we expect to be included in the **acknowledgements** of resulting
    publications.
