## Introduction

SalmoBase is a comprehensive data resource for Atlantic salmon and other salmonid genome information. The service provides access to browse through salmonid species genomes, specific gene assemblies and search for genetic data. Through SalmoBase, molecular genomic resources for salmonid species are continuously made publically available in a framework of visualisations and analytic tools. JBrowse, BLAST and SalMotifDB are sub tools provided to facilitate utilisation of the genomic salmonid data. Salmobase is the sister database of LiceBase.

Salmonids are ray-finned fishes which constitute 11 genera and at least 70 species including Atlantic salmon, whitefishes, graylings, rainbow trout, and char. The common ancestor of all Salmonidae experienced a whole genome duplication (WGD) ~80 million years ago, resulting in an autotetraploid genome. Genomic rediplodization is still going on in salmonid species, providing an unique system for studying evolutionary consequences of whole genome duplication. In recent years, high quality genome sequences of Atlantic salmon and Rainbow trout has been established, due to their scientific and commercial values.
