Join the first FAIR Data Management in Life Sciences course, organized by ELIXIR Norway 14-16 June 2022!**

14.—16. June, Virtual

### About

The course aims to cover topics covering the whole data life cycle (as shown in the [Research Data Management kit by ELIXIR Europe](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)) with a specific focus on the implementation of the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). The goal is to teach the key concepts on how to make life sciences data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for your research management. For queries, check out [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/elixir-oslo/fair-dm-2022-course/blob/main/faqs.md) and/or you can send mail to [contact@bioinfo.no](mailto:contact@bioinfo.no).

### Learning Objectives

- To walk through data life cycle steps with an introduction to tools relevant to life sciences research, including in a context of computational analysis for life sciences.
- To understand FAIR principles in the context of each data cycle step
- To understand the data curation processes that enable data reuse and repurposing
- To know the different RDM guidelines and practices used by the various RIs and institutions in Norway.

### Learning Outcomes

- To be able to define and connect RDM tasks within a domain of interest.
- To be able to determine different tools that are available, globally and in Norway, to carry out RDM tasks.
- To be able to identify metadata standards and to associate relevant deposition repositories
- To be able to analyse and evaluate FAIRness of Data (and Management Plan)

### Learning Activities

Each session will include time for a short discussion including questions and answers. We plan to have a group activity on last day of the course that will involve reviewing and discussing how to create a FAIR DMP. In addition, we plan to include a short quiz relevant to each session; learners are recommended to take a quiz during or after the course to help revise and understand the content learned throughout the course.

### Target Audience

The course is aimed at current and future life scientists in Norway. The target audience includes master’s students, PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, early-career researchers, and technical staff involved in scientific research in the life sciences in Norway. The course is particularly relevant for users and/or collaborators of the research infrastructures listed below:

- [NorSeq: National consortium for sequencing and personalised medicine](https://www.norseq.org/)
- [NOR-Openscreen: Consortium for chemical biology and early drug discovery](http://www.openscreen.no/)
- [NORMOLIM: Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure](https://normolim.w.uib.no/)
- [NALMIN: Norwegian Advanced Light Microscopy Imaging Network](https://nalmin.no/)
- [NORCRYST: Norwegian Macromolecular Crystallography Consortium](https://site.uit.no/norcryst/)
- [BBMRI-NO: National research infrastructure for clinical and population-based biobanks](https://bbmri.no/)
